- 👋 Hi, I’m @Quexiclact
- 👀 I’m interested in creating entirely too involved HTML-formatted fanfiction for Ao3
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... fanfiction? I don't really expect anyone to join me in my endeavors
- 📫 How to reach me: Comment on my html test fic on Ao3 -> https://archiveofourown.org/works/51597397
- 😄 Pronouns: Any
- ⚡ Fun fact: Geckos don't have eyelids, so they lick their eyeballs to keep them moist
